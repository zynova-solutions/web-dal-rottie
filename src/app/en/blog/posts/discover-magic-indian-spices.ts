Welcome to DAL ROTTI, Frankfurt's newest culinary gem, where the rich tapestry of North Indian cuisine comes to life. At our Indian restaurant, we invite you to embark on a flavorful journey through the diverse and aromatic world of Indian spices. Whether you're a connoisseur of Indian food or a curious newcomer, our dishes promise to tantalize your taste buds and transport you to the vibrant streets of North India.

## The Essence of Indian Spices

Indian cuisine is renowned for its bold and complex flavours, largely attributed to the skilful use of a variety of spices. Each spice has its own unique characteristics and health benefits, making Indian food not only delicious but also wholesome. Let's explore how some of these spices are used in our signature dishes at DAL ROTTI in Frankfurt.

## Turmeric: The Golden Spice

Turmeric, known for its bright yellow colour and earthy flavour, is a staple in North Indian cooking. It is celebrated for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. At DAL ROTTI, you'll find turmeric in our Chicken Curry, where it adds depth and a beautiful hue to the dish, and in Dal Tadka, enhancing the lentils with its subtle warmth.

## Cumin: The Aromatic Enhancer

Cumin seeds, with their distinctive nutty and peppery flavor, are essential in many North Indian dishes. They are often dry-roasted to release their full aroma before being ground into a powder. Try our Jeera Rice, where cumin seeds are sautéed in ghee to infuse the rice with a fragrant, earthy flavor, perfectly complementing any curry.

## Coriander: The Versatile Spice

Coriander seeds and leaves are widely used in Indian cuisine. The seeds offer a citrusy, slightly sweet flavor when ground, while the fresh leaves add a burst of freshness. Our Paneer Tikka features a marinade made with coriander powder, providing a zesty balance to the creamy paneer. Additionally, fresh coriander leaves garnish many of our dishes, adding a vibrant touch and a hint of citrus.

## Cardamom: The Queen of Spices

Cardamom, with its sweet and floral notes, is often used in both savory and sweet dishes. It plays a starring role in our Chicken Korma, where the ground seeds impart a delicate sweetness that harmonizes with the rich, creamy sauce. Cardamom is also a key ingredient in our Masala Chai, offering a comforting and aromatic finish to your meal.

## Garam Masala: The Spice Blend

Garam Masala is a blend of spices that typically includes cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, cumin, coriander, and black pepper. This spice mix is integral to many North Indian dishes, adding warmth and complexity. Our Butter Chicken is enriched with garam masala, which enhances the tomato-based sauce with its robust and balanced flavor profile.

## Mustard Seeds: The Pungent Pop

Mustard seeds are used for their pungent and slightly bitter flavor. When fried, they add a delightful crunch and burst of flavor to dishes. At DAL ROTTI in Frankfurt, you can enjoy mustard seeds in our Fish Moilee, a Kerala-style fish curry where the seeds are tempered in oil to release their unique aroma before being simmered with coconut milk and spices.

## Red Chili: The Fiery Kick

Red chilies bring heat and vibrant color to Indian cuisine. They are used in various forms—whole, crushed, or powdered. Our Chicken 65, a popular South Indian appetizer, features a fiery marinade with red chilli powder, offering a bold and spicy kick that is sure to excite your palate.

## Fenugreek: The Bitter-Sweet Note

Fenugreek leaves and seeds add a distinctive bitter-sweet flavor to dishes. They are known for their health benefits, including aiding digestion and reducing inflammation. Our Methi Malai Murg (Fenugreek Chicken) showcases fenugreek leaves in a creamy sauce, providing a delightful balance of bitterness and sweetness.

## Cloves: The Warm Spice

Cloves, with their intense aroma and sweet-spicy flavor, are often used in rice dishes and curries. At DAL ROTTI, cloves are an essential component of our Biryani, where they infuse the rice with a warm, aromatic flavor, complementing the tender pieces of meat and fragrant basmati rice.
